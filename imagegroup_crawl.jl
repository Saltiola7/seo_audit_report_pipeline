The most impressive.  Whatever that means. Following her election, however, the Prime Minister\u2019s voice was endlessly criticised and critiqued. Had she had voice coaching? Why the change? Which was her  real  voice?  Communication and Image Management  matters. Not just what we say, but how we say it. \u00a0 The voice of authority \u00a0 A more humorous example of the power of voice is a  recent skit  by the South African comedian Trevor Noah, in which he imagines what might have happened in a meeting which took place between the late Nelson Mandela and former President of the United States Barack Obama. \u00a0 The meeting  took place when Obama was a junior senator, and in Noah\u2019s reimagined scene Mandela coaches the young Obama, but not in the way you might expect. Noah describes Obama bouncing into the room, voice high and fast with excitement, and when Obama squeals: \u201cI\u2019m going to be just like you. And I\u2019m going to be the first black president of America!\u201d Mandela\u2019s immediate response is \u201cNot with that voice!\u201d \u00a0 Noah\u2019s scene continues with Mandela advising Obama to slow down, to add bass to his voice, to speak every word like it\u2019s the last word he\u2019ll ever speak and then to add the all-important husk. \u00a0 \u00a0 The skit ends with the two chanting (in husky, deep presidential voices) \u201cYes we can!\u201d \u00a0 Sure this exchange took place in Noah\u2019s mind, but the skit works because of the truth behind it \u2014 there  is  something impressive and presidential in these voices. Something which commands respect and attention. \u00a0 Effective communication matters because cognitive intelligence alone is not enough. When deciding if someone is worthy to lead we evaluate them not just on their merits or track record, but on their charisma and \u201cpresence\u201d. This is part of a person\u2019s emotional intelligence. If someone exudes an air of authority that inspires confidence, then we are likely to place our confidence in them. \u00a0 \u00a0 The hard sell \u00a0 An article I read recently by Jordan Gonen referred to communication as \u201c the most under-prioritised skill \u201d. And there is certainly a tendency to under-prioritise all \u201csoft\u201d skills \u2014 to assume that these are things which come naturally, whilst we focus on the more important aspects of our life and work. \u00a0 Guess what? While we\u2019re focusing on what we think is important, the most important skills (like emotional intelligence) are the ones we actually mess up. As Gonen points out: \u00a0 \u201cThere are essentially two parts to building a company: \u00a0 Building a product Getting users to use said product\u201d \u00a0 And that\u2019s where effective communication comes in. You can no longer say \u201cbuild it and they will come.\u201d If you want people to be as excited about your product as you are then you need to communicate with them. Communication is more than just talking at people \u2014 it is a conversation. Adding some emotion makes it memorable. It means listening, it means figuring out what your clients, co-workers, and stakeholders want, and then talking to them about that. \u00a0 \u00a0 The relationship factor \u00a0 Authentic communication  is all about relating to people \u2014 being talented and intelligent is no guarantee that you won\u2019t fall short when it comes to communication. Have you ever heard someone complain of a doctor with a terrible bedside manner? The doctor is capable and qualified, but a huge gap in their skill set creates an inability to treat the  whole  person. They are working transactionally and they are failing to interact on a relational level. \u00a0 When we communicate, we deliver our message through verbal and non-verbal techniques. There is no use in saying you are confident with a quivering voice. We must pay attention to what message our actions are sending, and see if this lines up with our  intended  message or not. \u00a0 Brands must communicate if they are to be effective. Personal brand, business brand, it doesn\u2019t matter. If effective communication is not helping to build relationships then the brand will fail. \u00a0 When I talk about a brand communicating I mean that it explains the heart of an individual and an organisation. Much more than a mission statement, this communication is a clarification of the balance and mixture of a brand\u2019s fundamental facts and values. \u00a0 So, to recap, here are some ways to sharpen your focus when it comes to communication: \u00a0 Communication matters. Not just what you say, but how you say it. If you exude an air of authority that inspires confidence, then people are more likely to place their confidence in you. Pay attention to what message your actions are sending, and see if this lines up with your  intended  message or not. \u00a0 Never underestimate communication as a \u201csoft\u201d skill \u2014 pay attention to communication as an important aspect of your life and work. All the work you have invested in your brilliant idea, start-up or pitch will get you nowhere if you can\u2019t communicate effectively. \u00a0 Work on your \u201cbedside manner\u201d. Authentic communication is all about relating to people \u2014 not reeling off a list of facts and figures, uploading information from your brain to theirs. Communicate authentically with your customers, stakeholders and colleagues. And don\u2019t talk  at  Remember real communication is a conversation. \u00a0 Everything you present to the world communicates. And I hope that this article will get you thinking about the ways in which you are communicating your brand message. Don\u2019t just leave it up to chance. Make communication a priority. \u00a0 Communication is the first aspect of what we at Image Group International like to call  \u2018The 7 Aspects of Authentic Image Management\u2019 TM  \u2013 a part of the IGI Personal Branding System. TM  This is more than just a slogan \u2013 the word  authentic  is there for a reason. Research shows we live in the most distrustful time in history. Our team want to work with you, to create the absolute best outcomes for your business and life.  I\u2019ll be releasing a series of videos covering these 7 aspects, and I\u2019d like to invite you to view them.

Have you ever been tempted to exaggerate just a tiny bit on your webpage, your LinkedIn account or your Twitter or Facebook profiles? And if you have, do you even care that your family and close friends know that you are a deluder? Heck, since our politicians are doing it daily who can blame us common folk. There are many people out there who do tell big lies, not some white lies but some of them absolute whoppers about the awards and accolades they have collected throughout their amazing careers. And fortunately, there are many who don\u2019t need to lie because they have a sense of honour. During your online travels, you will come across both sorts of personal brands, those with integrity and those without that may even turn out to be scammers. The latter are the narcissistic self-promoters. They are fervent believers in Adolf Hitler\u2019s dictum: \u2018If you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed.\u2019 The former have profiles that reflect their true experience, qualifications and capabilities. Their bios and profiles are simple and factual. Yes, they may be out there, although they\u2019re rather more self-effacing. But worse than the social media puffery is the way the less than truthful personal branders exaggerate their professional capabilities and backgrounds online. Some of \u00a0their claims are nothing but falsehods. If you take the time to check them out, you find it\u2019s as you suspected \u2013 the only true facts on their web pages are their names \u00a0and that at times may also be suspect (probably). So, if you\u2019re a deluder, do you know that you are one? Of course you do. How can your brand and your profession be worth anything if you don\u2019t believe in them yourself? Maybe you refer to yourself as the \u2018Number 1 award winning blogger.\u2019 Hmmm. Who said? Where can I find this information? Who awarded this much-coveted description? Who can verify your claims? But it must be true \u2013 it\u2019s all there on your profile. Or your webpage, written by you. Perish the thought that this interesting fact doesn\u2019t exist anywhere else, apart from in your over-active imagination. Maybe you\u2019ve advertised yourself (on your personal webpage) as the country\u2019s most successful leadership guru. Once again, I have to say hmmm \u2026 who said? Where can I find this information? Who awarded this much-coveted description? Who can verify your claims? Yes, I know I\u2019ve already asked those questions. I keep asking them of all the self-styled so-called experts, no matter whether they claim to be \u2018the nation\u2019s most critically awarded architect\u2019, \u2018the country\u2019s most successful investment broker\u2019 or \u2018my primary school\u2019s best goal-kicker\u2019. Sadly, there are thousands of so-called CEOs of so-called global companies who have just themselves on the payroll. They exist only in their imaginations and in their parent\u2019 basements. Maybe they\u2019ve attended a course and have now set up their own training establishments. Perhaps they\u2019ve self-published a \u2018how to\u2019 epic or advertised on YouTube. They may even have paid a fee to have their poetry included in a journal of winners\u2019 poetry. Whatever. This is the internet \u2013 a shining new world of vivid imagery and self-branded \u2018entrepreneurs\u2019. Just as well you have the commonsense to navigate your way through it. Right? Do you agree? Let us know your experience with online deluders.
